Extra Notes:
	I played the video on 1.5-2x to get through the content faster and had no problem. I also skipped note taking on some very simple things at the start.
----------

JavaScript is a language used for web and mobile development.
    - It is mainly used for making the front end of websites and mobile apps interactive.
        - We can also use frameworks with JavaScript like ReactJS, AngularJS, and VueJS to create good web apps.
    - It can also be used in the back end of websites, with certain technologies (Like node.js), to give the website client-server interactions
    - JavaScript has some similar syntax to C# and Java.

Web browsers are able to run JavaScript because they have internal javascript engines.
    - It is important that JavaScript is so widely supportered because then 90%+ of people can run our code natively
    - We can test the javascript engine in Google Chrome by typing "javascript: alert("test")" in the url bar.
        This will prompt us with text that says "test" and a button to dismiss it.
    - We can also test JavaScript in Google Chrome through opening the Chrome Dev Tools and using the Console to type in our commands.
